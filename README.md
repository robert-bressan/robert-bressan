Hi! My name is Robert and i study operations research and graph theory. I know little about coding, but I can perform some KOD (kludge-oriented development).
I try my KOD in three languages: Python, Javascript and VB (yes, sometimes is the only way to reach some systems)

I'm currently focused in change management, making an easier transition when some more skilled developers do their job and deliver new products or features. SAFe certified professional as PM and PO, sometimes I lead projects in oil and gas decommissioning tools, automating project tasks.
